I am Take Vos a software and hardware engineer based in Amsterdam. I've worked in diverse jobs,
including web development in the early 1990's, enterprise development and eventually developing
trading application on FPGAs at a proprietary trading firm.

For the last two years I've been working on my [TTauri project](https://github.com/ttauri-project/) GUI library.
This GUI library is written in C++20 and is designed to handle widgets that animate at the screen refresh rate,
this is useful in, for example audio or trading application, which have many widgets that need to display
continues changing values; like audio meters, real-time prices and clocks.

If you like to see what I am working, you may find me coding or gaming on my [twitch channel](https://twitch.com/tjienta/).
